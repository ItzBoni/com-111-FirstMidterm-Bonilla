****Midterm****

Hi, this is my first midterm for this class, I hope you like it teacher :)

*Dev Log*

Goals:
Complete this as quickly as possible, without overcomplicating stuff for myself.

Tasks completed:
1. Created a structure that I liked and that worked with the design proposed
2. Worked on stylesheets the most to achieve the look and feel of the page

Use of GenAI:
- No more than what Gemini says whenever you do a Google search nowadays. It did help out with understanding how to make the boxes appear with shadows :)

Challenges and Bugs:
- I battled with centering the divs, however after reading documentation from the allmighty w3schools I worked out a fix
- display: flex I love you

Personal reflection:
I feel satisfacted with the quality of the midterm, and the time it took to complete.
